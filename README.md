## What does it do?

Ever seen some "cursed" viceos on Discord and other platforms that have huge playtime or even negative? That's what this app does.

### Infinite Duration

## Installation

Grab the latest binary for your OS from the [releases page](https://github.com/GeopJr/exorcism/releases/latest).

All binaries are being built and pushed by our lovely github actions. Feel free to take a look at them or build it yourself!

## Why?

Apart from being fun, the reason I made this was just because a reddit comment suggested that modifying mp4 metadata was something "secret".
